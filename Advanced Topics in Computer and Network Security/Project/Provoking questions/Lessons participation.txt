62) When the webapp systems were analysed, there's a point in the paper where the authors mentioned the possibility, for some found systems, to go beyond the authentication page to analyse internal information. How this type of analysis has been done without having access to those systems? 
70) Talking about the defensive mechanisms for keylogging attacks, an option could be: obfuscate the side channel increasing the background noise. Is possible to clean the sound from the background noise in some ways? Maybe with some algorithms? If yes, do these techniques break this defensive line?

48) When the authors had to choose the dataset for this work, they chose the U.K., also because it has just one timezone. How could the number of timezones, of the chosen country, affect the result of this work?
50) How does the study account for the temporal aspect, considering that the dataset is based on the profile information and recent posts at a specific point in time? Is the result reliable yet?
