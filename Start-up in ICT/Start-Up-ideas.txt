*RESOURCE SHARING PLATFORM*

PROBLEM: reducing the industry enviromental impact

IDEA: Create an online platform where people can share underutilized resources such as tools, sports equipment, books, etc. 
This would promote sharing and waste reduction. 
    - Registered users can provide the list of all their sharable tools and they can decide lending and payment modalities.
    - It is possible to earn making subscriptions that provide other functionalities or thinking about sales commissions.
