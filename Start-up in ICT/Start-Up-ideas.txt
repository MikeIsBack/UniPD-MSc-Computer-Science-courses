1. PERSONAL DOCUMENTS MANAGER
=============================

PROBLEM: difficulty in finding personal digital documents to share when requested (such as passport, identity card, educational qualifications, etc.) 
--> possible scenarios: job applications, bonus applications



============================
2. RESOURCE SHARING PLATFORM
============================

PROBLEM: Reduce the waste of underutilized personal resources providing an effective way to make full use of them

IDEA: Create an online platform where people can share underutilized resources such as tools, sports equipment, books, etc. 

PROS:
- This would promote sharing and waste reduction --> reducing enviromental impact of industry. 
- This platform provides a way to get useful resources for a cheaper price instead buying them (for using just one time).

FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Registered users can provide the list of all their sharable tools and they can decide lending and payment modalities.
- It is possible to earn making subscriptions that provide other functionalities or thinking about sales commissions.
