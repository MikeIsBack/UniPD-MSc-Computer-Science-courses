Create groups of two students and create a presentation with 2/3 slides with:
	- example of positive design of a mobile application (correct usage of gestures, proper metaphor, correct use of instructions, just-in-time content, ...)
	- example of a wrong design. 

Provide at least one screenshot for each of the two examples and a brief description of the main points and why the design is correct or incorrect. For the wrong example, provide a possible solution to resolve the problem. 

The presentation will be held during the lesson on May 2nd (max 10 minutes for each group).
