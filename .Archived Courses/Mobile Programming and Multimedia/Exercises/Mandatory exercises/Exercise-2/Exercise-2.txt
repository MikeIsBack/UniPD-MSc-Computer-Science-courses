Mobile Design exercise

Data limite: marted√¨, 30 aprile 2024, 12:00

Create groups of two students and create a presentation with 2/3 slides with:

- an example of positive design of a mobile application (correct usage of gestures, proper metaphor, the use of correct instructions, just-in-time content, etc.) and 
- an example of a wrong design. 

Provide at least one screenshot for each of the two examples and a brief description of the main points and why the design is correct or incorrect. For the wrong example, provide a possible solution to resolve the problem. 

The presentation will be held during the lesson on 2nd or 3rd May (max 7-8 minutes for each group). 

Submission must be the same for each group member, so please write the other student's name in the first line. The name of the file must contain both the students' names
