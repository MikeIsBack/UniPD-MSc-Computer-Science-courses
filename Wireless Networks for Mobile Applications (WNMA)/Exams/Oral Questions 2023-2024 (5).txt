1) he drew a graph of a congestion window and he asked me to draw it again but knowing that the RTT is the double (the graph grows at double speed)
2) tell me what TCP protocols we have seen for satellite communications and explain one (TCP hybla and Westwood)
3) explain Bluetooth 
4) RTS CTS
5) what is the contention window?
