Until fourth exam:

For the exam, you can choose between taking it on paper or on the laptop. 
In laptop mode, you should login into Uniweb and take the exam. Like EMI exam, but on your laptop (without restrictions!)

After fourth exam:
- The exam will be on paper.
- No laptop or other electronic devices allowed.
- Multiple questions with "up to 2 pts" meaning more answers (two), "2 pts" means only one
- No limit on words when writing open questions
