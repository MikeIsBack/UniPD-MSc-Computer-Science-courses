- Please describe the structure of the “proportionality scrutiny” in no more than 200 words. (up to 6 pts).
```
The answer should describe the three-steps or four-steps proportionality scrutiny that courts often employ to balance competing rights and interests. The sequence is extremely relevant because the scrutiny is a test: if a measure fails to pass one step, the measure is unlawful and the scrutiny is over.
The steps are the following:
  1. Does the measure under scrutiny pursue a legitimate goal?
  2. Is the measure concretely connected with the purported goal (this is the “rational connection” step—some courts omit it)?
  3. Is the measure necessary to pursue that goal? (This is the “least restrictive means” step)
  4. Are the benefits more than the sacrifices that the measure causes to the interests and rights that are involved?
