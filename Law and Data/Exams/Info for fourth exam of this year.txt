To inform people not present in this exam: Pin actually told us about the announcement said regarding the choice of modality of exam and whatever; he gave us additional time (95 minutes instead of 75) and also no limit on words on open answers. 

Also, for multiple choice, since it was asked, when there were (up to 2 pts) means taking 2 answers, which just (2 pts) means one, to avoid future confusion to others
