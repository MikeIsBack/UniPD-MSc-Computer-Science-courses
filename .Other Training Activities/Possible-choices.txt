ATTENTION
=========

- BEFORE STARTING AN ACTIVITY, MAKE THE REQUEST WITH THE FORM IN THE MOODLE (JUST PUT "NO" TO THE FINAL QUESTION) AND WAIT FOR THE APPROVAL
- If we have some questions write to both responsible professors (Bresolin, Da San Martino)
- The credits are registered only when we have completed all the 6 credits. 5 calls to register them, one for each graduation cerimony.
