- solve the problem of lack of sync between victim and attacker ECU nodes during attack phase

- implement both attacker and victim frame auto-retransmission after a failed tx (now it increases the counter only by 8 and the attacker injects the frame every time it listens to it in the bus)

- after the first bus-off step (victim in error passive) repeat the sim (pattern analysis + attack) until the victim goes to bus-off
