WHAT TO CHANGE IN THE ACTUAL CODE: 

- IDs are randomly generated, do we want to achieve a specific order where the frames with more dominat bits are sent before less dominant ones?
Not necessary. Since we have only one ECU that regularly transmits there is no competition with other ECUs and so the order of IDs is not relevant. 

- the simulation (pattern analysis and attack) runs for a specified duration. This can be accepted for the pattern analysis while for the attack is unrealistic to predict the exact duration after which the victim ECU goes to bus-off. The idea is to make the code run until the attack is successfully performed. 

- check if preceded ID logic is correctly implemented.
