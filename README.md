# UniPD Master's Degree in Computer Science Courses

Welcome to my personal repository, where I have gathered the study materials, notes, and resources used during my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Padova. This repository serves as a structured collection of materials from the courses I attended, with a focus on Internet, Mobile, and Security topics.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The contents of this repository reflect my understanding of the courses and may contain errors. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to contact me. 

## 🎓 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended as a personal archive of my studies, helping me (and potentially others) consolidate knowledge in various computer science topics. It is not meant to replace official course materials but rather to supplement learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific course and contains:
- **Lecture Notes** – summaries and key takeaways   
- **Assignments & Exercises** – personal solutions and practice work  
- **Projects** – reports and discussions (the implementations, if any, are available in my other repositories)
