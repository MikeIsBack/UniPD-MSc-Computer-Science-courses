# UniPD Master's Degree in Computer Science Courses

Welcome to my personal repository, where I have gathered the study materials, notes, and resources used during my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the **University of Padova**. This repository serves as a structured collection of materials from the courses I attended, with a focus on **Internet, Mobile, and Security** topics.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific course and contains:
- **Lecture Notes** – Summaries and key takeaways   
- **Assignments & Exercises** – Personal solutions and practice work  
- **Projects** – Reports and discussions (the implementations are available in my other repositories)  

## 🎓 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended as a personal archive of my studies, helping me (and potentially others) consolidate knowledge in various Computer Science subjects. It is **not** meant to replace official course materials but rather to supplement learning.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The contents of this repository reflect my understanding of the courses and may contain errors. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to contact me.
